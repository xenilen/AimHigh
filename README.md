# AimHigh

I found a neat trick called savePDF() which allows you to just print off the certificates of completion on 1/14/2018 (First/last day I had to complete a training).

Since I am an expert procrastinator, Aimhigh was completed 2/8/2020, and was made obselete a few weeks ago.  Hence the releasing of this code.
